Remove peels and cinnamon sticks and allow to come to room temperature before using.\nCombine walnuts, almonds, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves and 3 tablespoons melted butter together in a bowl and mix thoroughly.\nPlace phyllo between sheets of waxed paper and cover with a slightly damp towel to prevent phyllo from drying out.  Brush bottom and sides of an 18x12-inch inch pan generously with melted butter.\nPlace 8 phyllo sheets into bottom of pan, brushing each sheet generously with butter.  Take an additional 4 sheets of phyllo and place in pan allowing sheets to drape over each of the 4 sides of pan.  Brush these with melted butter.\nSpread 2 cups of nut mixture into pan, distributing evenly over bottom.  Fold over the overlapping phyllo sheets brushing each with butter, to envelop the nut mixture.\nRepeat layering process 2 more times to form 3 nut layers.\nTop pastry with remaining phyllo dough and generously brush top layer with melted butter.  Tuck in the buttered phyllo neatly around.\nScore through top layers of pastry with a sharp knife making 6 strips lengthwise then cut 10 strips diagonally to form diamond shaped pieces.  Stud each diamond-shaped piece (and any odd looking ones near the ends of the pan) in the centre with a whole clove per piece.  Pour remaining melted butter over pastry and lightly sprinkle some water on top too (wet your hand under the tap twice and shake this out over the pastry).\nBake pastry in a 325\u00b0F oven for 1 hour to 75 minutes, until nicely golden-brown.  Allow to cool for 5 minutes.  Carefully spoon cool syrup over seam in pastry.  Allow to stand at least 3 hours or overnight.  Cut through the scored pieces and serve.\nNote:  The clove studding each piece is not traditionally eaten, it is removed by the person whose piece it is before eating.  The clove is there to add its 'perfume' to the piece as it bakes (and it looks pretty, too).",

  "title": "Macarons",
  "instructions": "Combine almond flour and icing sugar in a food processor. Pulse for 30 seconds until light, airy and fine.\nSift the icing sugar and almond powder mixture into a large mixing bowl and set aside.\nIn a small saucepan, combine sugar and water. Stir until all the sugar is moistened. Try not to get any sugar up the sides of the saucepan as this will burn.\nFit the saucepan with a candy thermometer and set over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and cook until the thermometer reaches 238&deg;F DO NOT STIR.\nImmediately after turning on the heat under the sugar, add egg whites to the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with a whisk attachment and start to whip on medium speed.\nOnce the egg whites are foamy, add the lemon juice and continue to beat until soft, rounded peaks form.\nWhen the sugar syrup is ready, pour into the whipping egg whites by gently tipping the saucepan into the space between the whisk and the side of the bowl, using the side of the bowl as a guide. You want a slow, steady stream of syrup to pour into the egg whites. You can pour the sugar directly down the inner side of the bowl, using the lip of the bowl as a rest, if it is easier on your wrists.\nOnce all the sugar is incorporated into the egg whites, turn the mixer up and whip the egg whites until stiff peaks form and the bowl of the mixer is no longer warm.\nIf you wish to add food colouring, add it now to the egg whites. The food colouring must be in powder or gel form, do not use liquids.\nUsing a rubber spatula, scrape half of the egg whites out and fold into the almond flour mixture until fully combined.\nFold in the remaining egg whites into the almond mixture and mix well.\nNow it is time to stir. This step is called \"Macaronn\u00e9e\", which is basically slapping the mixture against the side of the bowl using the spatula to thin the mixture. It is ready when a scoop of the mixture falls from the spatula in a continuous ribbon and disappears back into the batter in the bowl in about 15 seconds. *This is part that will usually make or break the cookies.\nFit a large piping bag with a round tip and spoon the mixture into the bag.\nUse a baking sheet fit with a silicone baking mat (best results) or a piece of parchment paper cut to size.\nPipe equal rounds of batter about 1.5\" apart. Use steady pressure when pushing the batter out of the bag to ensure equal rounds. I also count to three, then I move on the the next and repeat. That's my little trick. Pipe straight up and down so the rounds are perfect. the piped macarons should look like flattened Hershey's kisses.\nGently tap the bottom of the pastry sheets to smooth the macarons tops. *This will smooth out the \"nipples\" as I call them. The little points from where the piping bag was pulled up.\nLet the macarons sit for 1 to 2 hours until the tops are dry to the touch and matte. The time will differ based on multiple variables so don't worry if it takes less or more time.\nPreheat oven to 275&deg;F.\nWhen macarons are dry, bake them in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes. *They should have a smooth, rounded shell-like top and a \"foot\" which looks like a thin cloud.\nLet the macarons cool completely before removing them from the trays. They should have a smooth, rounded shell-like top and a \"foot\" which looks like a thin cloud.\nOnce the macarons are cool, you can package them and freeze them, or fill them with your desired flavoured buttercream, chocolate or fruit filling.",
